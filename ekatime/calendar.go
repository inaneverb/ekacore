	// Calendar is a special type that represents a gregorian calendar
	// extending it with business calendar features, like:
	// - Supporting workdays and day offs,
	// - Supporting holidays or unscheduled work days,
	// - Caching the "today" state,
	// - Encoding the "today" day as JSON or user's defined encoder (+caching),
	// - Callback when new day has come (ctrl+c protected, graceful shutdown)
	// - Thread-safety updating when running,
	// - Updating logging,
	// etc.
	//
	// So, in most cases you need ONLY ONE INSTANCE of Calendar for the whole
	// your service. Trust me, it's enough, even in some cases when you need
	// different events.
	//
	// Create a Calendar object, configure it (add events, encoders), and call Run().
	// IT IS IMPORTANT! THE CALENDAR WON'T WORK CORRECTLY IF Run() WOULD NOT BE CALLED!
	//
	// -----
	//
	// When Calendar will be running you may access to the current's day state by:
	//
	// 1. Your own registered callback by WhenNewDay() method, that will be called
	//    when new day has come (at midnight, 00:00:00 (12:00:00AM)),
	//    and *Today object will be passed.
	//
	// 2. Use Today() method.
	//    It will return the cached *Today object (very fast accessing),
	//    ready to any usage.
	//
	// -----
	//
	// Using Today object you may get an info about current day and current month
	// like:
	// - What today the day is,
	// - Whether it's day off or not,
	// - Workdays number in month,
	// - How much workdays has been passed (or what is working day today),
	// etc.
	//
	// See https://github.com/qioalice/ekago/ekatime/today.go for more info.
