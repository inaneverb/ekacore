// Observe is your service initializer.
// It provides a mechanism of graceful shutdown, supporting OS signals (like SIGINT)
// and requested shutdowns from ekadeath or ekalog.
//
// First of all. You need a special "main" context.
// If you pass nil as context.Context, the context.Background() will be used.
// The difference is:
//  - Overwritten background context can be canceled ONLY by OS signals;
//  - Your context can be cancelled by your hands manually AND by OS signals.
// This context will be used to be able to say your jobs that it's time to stop
// their work and they need to be completed completely.
//
// Next thing is sync.WaitGroup.
// This is the same logic. If you pass nil, the new sync.WaitGroup will be created
// and used. The limitations and difference is also the same.
// You can do some job with your sync.WaitGroup expanding their area of responsibility,
// created sync.WaitGroup will live only inside Observe() and its internal parts.
//
// The last thing is your callback.
// Think about that callback like it's your "main()" function but with
// sync.WaitGroup's based protector and context.Context's based shutdown notifier.
// So, you can run your jobs, pass them shutdown context (or modified)
// and wait group to be able to wait until their jobs are completed.
// This is the main purpose of that function.
//
// WARNING!
// You can call Observe() ONLY ONE per whole lifetime of your binary.
// The next call will lead to panic.
//
// NOTE.
// You may think that it's always better to use your own context and wait group,
// but actually it depends on your needs. Moreover it's normal and better practice
// if you don't need such context and wait group outside the Observe()
// according with design pattern. Thus an ability to use your context and/or wait group
// is an "extension" to main functionality and purpose of Observe().
