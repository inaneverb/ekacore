type (
	// CI_WriterHttp is a type that implements an io.Writer - legacy Golang interface,
	// doing write encoded log's entry as []byte to the some HTTP service using
	// desired API.
	//
	// Features:
	// -----------
	//
	// 1. Async transport.
	//    When you calling Write() it just pushes encoded entry (as []byte)
	//    to the worker and does not blocks the routine.
	//    Spawn as many workers (at the initialization) as you want.
	//    See SetWorkersNum() method.
	//
	// 2. Thread-safe.
	//    You may call CI_WriterHttp to as many goroutines as you want.
	//    The CommonIntegrator under the hood just calls Write() for all
	//    writers they holds on.
	//
	// 3. Accumulated bulk deferred requests.
	//    Has an internal buffer of encoded log entries (as []byte)
	//    (see SetBufferCap() method), each worker pulling data from
	//    and putting to its own internal buffer (see SetWorkerBufferCap() method).
	//
	//    When worker buffer is full or when it's time to flush the accumulated data
	//    (the stopping of app or flush time has come), sends accumulated data
	//    to the HTTP service.
	//
	// 4. Control how encoded log entries will be combined before sending.
	//    Each worker aggregates a single encoded log entries with others
	//    to the log entries pack (contains many encoded log entries) before send it.
	//
	//    You may set HOW they will be combined:
	//
	//        - Need to put something to buffer before first encoded log entry added?
	//          (see AddBefore() method).
	//
	//        - Need to put something to buffer after last encoded log entry added?
	//          (see AddAfter() method).
	//
	//        - Need to put something to buffer between encoded log entries?
	//          I mean between all of them, excluding before first and after last.
	//          (see AddBetween() method).
	//
	// 5. Flushing data each N time intervals.
	//    Each worker flushes accumulated data on demand (the internal buffer is full)
	//    or at the timeout you may set (see SetWorkerAutoFlushDelay() method).
	//
	// 6. Slow down when service unavailable or network error.
	//    If request sending at the some worker is failed
	//    (it's only network or log service issue if you configure writer well),
	//    the usage of HTTP API service will slow down, logging what happens
	//    and why and saving (not dropping) your logs to the internal buffer.
	//
	//    They will send when connection will be restored.
	//    You may set the deferred log entries pack buffer capacity
	//    (pack, because each worker builds a pack of log entries, remember? see p.3)
	//    (see SetDeferredBufferCap() method).
	//
	// 7. Graceful shutdown.
	//    Of course, if you're familiar of ekadeath package. If you're not yet,
	//    it's time to: https://github.com/qioalice/ekago/ekadeath .
	//
	//    When you calling ekadeath.Die(), ekadeath.Exit() or writing a log
	//    with the level that marked as fatal, you won't lost aggregated logs!
	//
	//    The package will sends the rest of logs for the last time for you.
	//    And you do not need to do something for that.
	//
	// 8. Auto-initialization:
	//    You do need to call methods like Start() or something like that.
	//    You may check whether you configuration is valid calling Ping() method,
	//    but it's not necessary.
	//
	//    Just call all configuration methods with the chaining style and pass
	//    CI_WriterHttp object to the CommonIntegrator's WriteTo() method
	//    (or to your own logging integrator) and there is!
	//    The CI_WriterHttp will be initialized at the first Write() call.
	//
	// 9. Configurable to use any service.
	//    It's a very customizable type using which you may stream your logs safely
	//    to the log aggregation services like:
	//         - DataDog: https://www.datadoghq.com/ : UseProviderDataDog(),
	//         - Rollbar: https://rollbar.com/       : UseProviderRollbar(),
	//         - GrayLog: https://www.graylog.org/   : UseProviderGrayLog(),
	//         - Sentry:  https://sentry.io/         : UseProviderSentry(),
	//         etc.
	//
	//     For those services, CI_WriterHttp has a methods (3rd column)
	//     that makes it easy to configure it for, but you may configure it manually.
	//
	//     If you want to manually set HTTP service use UseProviderManual() method,
	//     providing a fasthttp's Request initializer for your service.
	//
	// 10. Fast.
	//     Uses fasthttp ( https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp ) under the hood,
	//     as http client. Pools, reusing, caching, optimizations. All you need.
	//

	//
	// WARNING!
	// DO NOT CALL Write() or Ping() METHODS UNTIL YOU FINISH ALL PREPARATIONS!
	// DO NOT PASS WRITER TO THE CommonIntegrator's WriteTo() METHOD UNTIL
	// YOU FINISH ALL PREPARATIONS!
	// IF YOU DO, THE CHANGES WILL NOT BE SAVED!
	//
	// WARNING! PANIC CAUTION!
	// YOU MUST SET THE LOG SERVICE YOU WANT TO WRITE LOG ENTRIES TO.
	// CHOOSE A PREDEFINED OR USE YOUR OWN.
	// IF YOU DO NOT DO THAT, THE INITIALIZATION WILL PANIC!
